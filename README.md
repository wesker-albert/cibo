# CIBO

(SEE-boh)

An experimental MUD server, written in Python. Object-oriented and event driven.

## What is a "MUD"?

## Why?

I loved MUDs as a teen. They were like living, breathing choose your own adventure books.

When I first started my career as a software engineer, I knew there was a possibility
that I'd be working in Python, but at that point I had virtually no experience in it.
I needed a learning project that interested me, that I could hack around with and
get a basic feel for the language.

That project ended up being a sloppy bowl of spaghet, that I dubbed "Office Crawler."
It was a very rudimentary MUD server with a map based upon the floorplan of the office
I was working in at the time. It wasn't pretty, and was hardly finished, but it
gave me the toe dip into the pool of Python that I wanted.

Fast forward to now, years later. Cibo is an attempt to pick up what I started with
Office Crawler. But this time it's a new learning project, where I can practice more
advanced architectural designs and patterns that I've learned since, or been curious
about but haven't gotten the professional opportunity to try.
